# Specification Quality Checklist: CSV Processing Pipeline

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-01-22  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification derived from comprehensive gap analysis in [gaps_and_enhancements.md](../../_base/002-data-enchancements/gaps_and_enhancements.md)
- All design decisions (Q1-Q5) were resolved prior to spec creation
- Reference implementations provide clear implementation guidance
- Out of scope items explicitly documented to prevent scope creep
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate task breakdown
